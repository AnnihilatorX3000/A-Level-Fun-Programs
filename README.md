# A-Level-Fun-Programs
A collection of programs (VB.Net and C#) created for fun in a computer lab during my A-Levels

DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAMS:

Eye Killers - .exe files that aim to strain the user's eyes.

Project Euler - A collection of programs created to solve some of the first problems on https://projecteuler.net/ .

VB_CraneThingy - A "boop simulator" where a rectangular object moves in one direction, bumps off the wall, and moves the other direction.
                 The longer you leave the program, the more counters are added. There is an end-point but it will take a long time to reach.
                 The program also comes with a day/night cycle!
                 
VB_Fun - An incomplete attempt at a text-based adventure game.

VB_GridGameThing - An experimental program that simulates Langton's Ant (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWBToaXK5T0).
                   This was my first, but rejected, idea for my A-Level CS Project.
                   Unfortunately, I do not remember how the program works.

VB_PaintRipOff - Self-explanatory.
